# Megsy — roadmap

## Fixed in the QA pass
- Computer tasks: terminal state (done/failed + result text) is written only after the
  external environment confirms it (`src/lib/computer/client.ts`, `persistTerminalState`).
- Browser steps in the agent tool runtime really execute on the cloud computer instead of
  returning a fake `BROWSER_STEP:` string (`src/lib/agentTools/runtime.ts`).
- The agent cannot declare completion while external work is still running
  (`src/lib/agentkernel/kernel.ts`).
- Execution events are no longer chat messages: one status line while running, steps in a
  collapsed list, only the final report as a message.
- Stale `running` computer rows (>10 min) are reconciled once on load
  (`src/lib/computer/taskIndicators.ts`).
- Desktop blank screen: `src/styles/deferred.css` shipped `@tailwind utilities`, emitting an
  unlayered copy of every utility that beat the responsive variants.
- `/` rendered the template placeholder instead of the SPA (`src/routes/index.tsx`).
- Code blocks vanished from answers: `stripLearnBlocks` had an optional fence flag
  (`src/components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx`).
- Image edit follow-ups ("now make the bicycle red") went to the text model and produced
  nothing; they now route to the image pipeline with the previous image as reference
  (`src/lib/media/autoMediaIntent.ts`, `detectImageEditIntent`).
- Cost: the mandatory reviewer round-trip was removed; the higher reviewer runs only when
  self-review finds a real gap.
- Unstyled/broken first paint: every stylesheet was imported from `src/lib/spaBoot.ts`, a
  client-only dynamic chunk, so the server HTML carried no stylesheet. All render-critical
  CSS now lives in `src/styles/app.css`, imported by `src/routes/__root.tsx`, so it ships as
  a `<link>` with the document. Import order preserved.
- Dark flash before the light UI: the boot shell was hard-coded dark while the default theme
  is light. `THEME_BOOT_SCRIPT` in `__root.tsx` resolves the stored theme before first paint
  and `BOOT_STYLE` is theme-aware (auth screens stay dark).
- Dead code: 60 unreachable modules deleted (unused shadcn primitives, `serviceRouter`,
  `intentDetector`, `openManus`, `coderStackBlitz`, `persistentCache`, …), the leftover
  template `src/styles.css` removed, and 26 unused npm packages dropped (antd, recharts,
  `@lobehub/ui`, `@imgly/background-removal`, unused Radix packages, …).
- Visual QA: auth videos now cover every tested viewport, long labels and settings rows wrap,
  the chat composer stays visually stable on focus, and narrow-phone loading no longer goes blank.
- React 19 nested-router warning removed by seeding browser history before React mounts.

## QA pass (September 2026)
- [ ] Real Runway image and video verification blocked: both provider requests now return "You do not have enough credits to run this task". The test account's Megsy balance is separate from Runway's provider balance. Image request schema and aspect ratio were corrected; re-test after the Runway account is funded.
- [x] Re-deployed Runway video creation and repaired the video polling deployment;
  removed duplicate client-side video quota reservation.
- [ ] Video output cannot be visually verified until Runway provider credits are restored; the service returns a 502 and refunds the app credits.
- [ ] Plus AI provenance and PPTX output remain unverified: four authenticated `chat-slides-stream` jobs completed with `output.deck` rather than `output.standardSlides`/PPTX. Two contrasting templates produced some different layouts but identical stored palettes; chat applies the selected palette before display. Verify deployed provider integration and visual variety in actual chat decks.
- Seedance offer dialog: no focus ring on the CTA (`SeedanceOfferDialog.tsx`).
- Computer surface: collapsed pill only, no reserved space, no duplicated status
  (`ComputerRunViewport.tsx`) — live status stays in the thinking badge above it.
- Computer narration answers in the user's language (`src/lib/languageDirective.ts`).
- Files open on their own page `/file-preview/:id` instead of an in-chat overlay.
- Sign-out goes through one resilient helper (`src/lib/signOutEverywhere.ts`).
- Non-chat pages use the same 320px sidebar width as chat (settings, mail, pricing, referrals).
- Chat empty state: new line + serif display face (`DesktopGreeting.tsx`).
- Image models route through `anything-api`; slides cards render the real first slide.

## Open
- [x] Keep the send button in its working state until image/video generation actually finishes.
- [x] Make the active service selector a full-width top bar inside the composer.
- [x] Desktop first chat screen: keep composer text and placeholder clearly white.
- [x] Rebuild empty desktop chat (video, Megsy left, small Upgrade right, shortcuts under input; no nav links/footer).
- [x] Restore the light chat palette, composer surface, chips, shadows, and serif greeting from the loving-bonds-app reference without changing chat behavior or the dark theme.
- [x] Report the actual 48-person funnel: visit, signup start/completion, payment page/method, Vodafone Cash, and proof/order completion.
- [ ] Track each page view's visitor country.
- [ ] Redesign the four first-run slides with modest Arab-region imagery, distinct rising color transitions, and repaired slide-four text.
- On mobile, Enter inserts a newline instead of sending; only the Send button sends.
- The Learning mode chip needs horizontal scrolling in the mobile mode bar to be reachable.
- MCP / Integrations and Files were not exercised end to end in this pass.
- [done] Mode chips restyled and made smaller (StarterCards + MobileModeBar).
- No white screen / no loading screen: the site must appear instantly on first paint.

- [done] AdRoll pixel integrated site-wide (lazy load + SPA pageView).

## UI/UX batch 1 (done)
- [done] ScrollToBottomButton restored (was `return null`); wired via ChatMessagesArea, sticky centered, count badge, ar/en aria.
- [done] ChatMessage: removed dead swipe hint/handlers; added Regenerate + Branch actions; ar/en labels for More/Copy/Edit/Like/Dislike/Copied/Download/Resume/interrupted; logical `end-0`/`text-start`; menu `dir` follows UI lang; touch targets 28px -> 36px.
- [done] AppSidebar: chat search input (shown when >5 conversations) filtering titles, with "No matches" state.
- [done] Clean-design pass: scroll-to-bottom button and sidebar search are borderless/transparent with light 1.75-stroke icons; message "More" button lost its hover fill.

## Requests 15 Sep (evening)
- [x] Separate Google sign-up button from email sign-up button (more vertical spacing).
- [x] Keep mobile sidebar/menu toggle on the same side on every page (landing + app pages).
- [x] TikTok Pixel added site-wide; CompletePayment fires only after a verified paid order, with duplicate protection.
- [x] TikTok Events API (server-side) sends the same CompletePayment with a shared event_id; access token stored as a secret, triple duplicate protection.
- [x] Mobile Google and email registration buttons separated with a fixed visible gap.
- [ ] Chips too small -> enlarged; verify visually.
- [ ] Plus menu look rejected -> redesign.
- [ ] Trial offer: show "3 days for $1" in place of $7, auto-renew to $7 after trial.
- [ ] Computer mode "failed to fetch" on production (Vercel) -> route everything through Supabase.
- [ ] Hide Mail (@megsyai.com) across all its pages/entries until redesigned.
- [ ] Arabic wallet/Visa payment sheet looks bad — restyle with design tokens.
- [ ] Arabic visitors: show prices in local currency detected from the device locale/timezone.
- [x] Local currency beside USD prices (device country) — desktop + mobile pricing.
- [x] Facebook-style next-hop prefetch replaces bulk chunk warming; loading fallback removed.

## Nomi rebuild
- [ ] Rebuild the product UI as Nomi inside the existing React SPA; do not introduce TanStack page architecture.
- [ ] Keep the permanent chat as home, first-use welcome, contextual animated avatar, and calls screen.
- [ ] Isolate all new persisted data in `nomi_*` tables without altering legacy Megsy tables.

## Restructure (September 30, 2026)
- [x] Chat chips, mode bars and model pickers removed; every message goes to the single agent.
- [x] Agent = Browser Use Cloud on `deepseek-v4-flash-vision`, served by `media-video` (`kind: "agent"`). Live computer only when a real page was opened; files only when produced.
- [x] Images fixed to Runway `gpt_image_2`, quality `low` (`media-video`, `kind: "image"`).
- [x] Videos: free = MiniMax Hailuo 1/day, subscribers = Seedance 2.5 5/day (`consume_daily_video`).
- [ ] Add WaveSpeed keys at `/k` (none stored yet) — blocked on the owner.
- [ ] Live end-to-end test while signed in — the preview can't sign in automatically on this backend.
- [ ] Image generation has no usage limit or charge yet (to be set with "the other limits").
- [x] Integrations now live only on `/integrations`; chat triggers navigate there instead of opening a sheet.
- [x] Provider thinking output streams into the Megsy-star status line and persists with task events.
- [x] Knowledge moved inside the Memory page; notification pages and settings entries were removed.

## Life assistant (Sep 30 2026)
- [x] Tasks page /tasks (goals, tasks, ideas), agent [[TASK/ALARM/GOAL]] lines saved to life_* tables
- [x] In-app reminders (ReminderWatcher polls scheduled_nudges)
- [ ] Google Calendar per-user connection (needs Google OAuth client approval)
- [ ] Background push reminders + daily brief when app is closed (needs push setup + scheduler)
- [ ] Android wrapper: real phone alarms (Capacitor)
- [ ] Connect Firebase Cloud Messaging (blocked: user must approve the Firebase connection)
- [ ] Android developer adds the MegsyAndroid bridge from docs/android-bridge.md (blocked: outside this project)
- [ ] Publish the site so the every-minute reminder check reaches it
