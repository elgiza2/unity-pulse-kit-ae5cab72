/**
 * @doc Specialist sub-agents.
 *
 * The main agent is a manager: instead of doing every kind of work itself with
 * one prompt, it delegates a bounded sub-task to a specialist that has its own
 * role prompt and its own slice of the tool catalog, then reads the specialist's
 * report and continues. This is what makes broad, open-ended requests finish:
 * research, coding, data and writing run as separate focused loops.
 *
 * Sub-agents are deliberately bounded (step cap, no nested spawning) so a run
 * can never fan out forever.

You work alone on ONE sub-task and cannot spawn other agents.
Reply with JSON only, one action at a time:
{"thought":"one short sentence","tool":"tool_search|<catalog tool id>","args":{...}}
or, when the sub-task is done:
{"report":"your findings/result, self-contained, with numbers, dates and sources"}
Use tool_search with a plain-language need when you don't know a tool id: {"tool":"tool_search","args":{"need":"..."}}
Your starting toolbox:
