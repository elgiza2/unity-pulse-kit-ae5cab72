/** @doc Client-side pricing offer state.
 *
 *  Two offers, both driven by what the user already did:
 *
 *  1. Abandoned checkout → the same fixed first-month price.
 *     Returning to /pricing after an incomplete checkout must never change
 *     the advertised first-month price.
 *
 *  2. Second month at the intro price (handled by SecondMonthOfferCard) is only
 *     shown AFTER a successful first payment — never before.
 *
 *  Amounts are display-only; the charged amount always comes from the server
 *  catalog (Kashier product ids).
